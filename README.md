# FolderControllerXII
Folder enhancement and layout tweak for iOS 11.0-12.1.2
Developed on-device on iOS 9.3.3 iPhone using theos with 9.2 set as main SDK....
RECENTLY updated on-device with iOS 11.3.1 using 11.2 SDK, this build only supports iOS 11.0 and higher.


Work in progress. No main plan was devised originally besides adding a few simple options
for folders. Over time it got bigger and bigger and I keep having ideas and requests for more options.
Added this to GitHub to start forcing myself to get more organized, and to make it simpler for people to be able to help with translations and any bug fixes.

Just updated this again 4/4/19 with latest version. Permissions may not be right since used a zip and Working Copy app to commit/ push updates.... I have a lot of cleanup to do, but added it anyway so a friend could see what I was working with, to be able to more easily suggest improvements.
