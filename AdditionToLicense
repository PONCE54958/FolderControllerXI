ALL aspects of original license apply, but with a few constraints.

1.) I do not permit use of this code to publish a tweak in a default repo
without my express written permission until this tweak is officially out of it's beta stage and has been published in a default repo itself.
Electronic direct messages giving consent can be considered permission, inside any messaging or social media app.

2.) LucaGeek aka CydiaGeek is not permitted to use any of the code from this tweak at any time, nor publish a slightly modified version.

3.) Anyone may feel free to contribute to this tweak, and credit will be given in the settings and if tweak is released as a paid tweak a portion
of the proceeds will be given to whoever helped contribute. Arrangements would be made before selling the tweak, such that all contributing parties 
are satisfied. If a contribution is made and percentage of sales is not agreed upon by all contributing parties tweak will be released for free, with donate links
to the contributors.

4.) This license should be included with original one. As original license does not permit amending, this is an additional license, not amendment. 
Once tweak is finished and released in a default repo, this addition will no longer be required.
