# FolderControllerXI
Folder enhancement and layout tweak for iOS 7-11.x
Developed on-device on iOS 9.3.3 iPhone using theos with 9.2 set as main SDK.
RECENTLY updated on-device with iOS 11.3.1 using 11.2 SDK, this build only supports iOS 11.0 and higher.


Work in progress, plz don't judge. No main plan was devised originally besides adding a few simple options
for folders. Over time it got bigger and bigger and I keep having ideas and requests for more options.
Just added this to GitHub to start forcing myself to get more organized, hopefully get additional contributor(s), show newer developers how certain features were made, and to be able to clone it on to my other devices or laptop for future updates.
